# Latent Cluster VAE (LCVAE)

This repository contains the official implementation of the **Latent Cluster Variational Autoencoder (LCVAE)**, a novel generative model for producing high-quality synthetic tabular data in the context of network intrusion detection. LCVAE explicitly structures the latent space into class-specific ellipsoidal clusters, enabling interpretable and controllable sample generation with tunable diversity.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### Core Models
- `lcvae.py`: Implementation of the Latent Cluster VAE model, including cluster-aware latent space design and sampling control via the epsilon parameter.
- `gmvae.py`: Baseline Gaussian Mixture VAE model for comparison, using a learned mixture in latent space.

### Training Scripts
- `train_lcvae.ipynb`: Training notebook for the LCVAE model on NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017 datasets.
- `train_gmvae.ipynb`: Training notebook for the GMVAE model using the same experimental setup.

### Generation Scripts
- `generation_lcvae.ipynb`: Generates synthetic data using the trained LCVAE model, with configurable dispersion parameter \(\epsilon\).
- `generation_gmvae.ipynb`: Generates synthetic samples from the GMVAE baseline.
- `generation_other_models.ipynb`: Generation scripts for external models (TVAE, CTGAN, CopulaGAN, SMOTE, ADASYN) for comparative purposes.

### Evaluation
- `evaluation_metrics.ipynb`: Computes evaluation metrics such as fidelity (Wasserstein), diversity (Vendi, Diversity Gap), class balance, and utility (TSTR).
- `evaluation_graphics.ipynb`: Generates plots and visual comparisons of the results across models and datasets.
- `global_results_nslkdd.csv` / `global_results_cicids.csv`: Aggregated performance metrics for each generation method.

### Generations & Results
- `generations_nsl/`, `generations_cicids/`: Generated datasets from LCVAE, GMVAE, and external models on NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017.
- `results_nsl/`, `results_cicids/`: Evaluation outputs (figures, scores) for each dataset.

### Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- `Preprocessing.ipynb`: Prepares the datasets (NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017), including label encoding, feature selection, and formatting.
- `typed_nslkdd_all_features.pkl` / `typed_cicids2017_all_features.pkl`: Pickled objects containing typed schema for each dataset, used in transformation pipelines.
- `typed_data_transformer_gmm.py`: Utility script for applying GMM-based preprocessing transformations (e.g., for continuous or integer features).

### Cluster Management
- `cluster_center_generation.py`: Generates class-wise latent cluster centers distributed on a hypersphere with minimal overlap, used to structure the LCVAE latent space.
